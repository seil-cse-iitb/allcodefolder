    <string name="avoid_peak">As we have been advancing, the goal to control the maximum demand is to not exceed the limit of the contracted power. To archive this goal, we advise to install a system able to disconnect non critical loads, on different time periods, and also avoid connecting loads simultaneously to reduce the instantaneous power.
Non-critical loads are those that do not affect the main production process or that are not essential, such as:\n
&#8226;Lighting\n
&#8226;Compressors\n
&#8226;Air-conditioning systems\n
&#8226;Pumps\n
&#8226;Fans and extractors\n
&#8226;Packaging machines\n
